As of the latest data available, the performance of thermoelectric materials is typically evaluated by their dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The top-performing thermoelectric materials are constantly evolving due to advances in material science. Here's a table of some of the best-performing thermoelectric materials based on ZT values from recent studies:

| Rank | Material           | ZT Value | Temperature Range (K) | Description                          |
|------|--------------------|----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1    | SnSe (Single Crystal) | ~2.6    | ~923 K                | High-performance p-type material, suitable for high-temperature applications. |
| 2    | PbTe - SrTe Nanostructured | ~2.2   | 800-900 K            | Lead telluride alloying with strontium telluride nanoparticles for enhanced performance. |
| 3    | SnSe (Polycrystalline) | ~2.0    | 773-923 K             | Large-scale synthesis suitable, retains good performance. |
| 4    | AgPb(m)SbTe(2+m) (LAST) | ~2.0   | 673 K                | Complex lead-antimony-silver-telluride compounds engineered for optimization. |
| 5    | Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 Alloys | ~1.8     | 300-400 K             | Widely-used commercial materials for room-temperature applications. |

Please note that these values can vary based on the specific synthesis method, material processing, and measurement techniques used in the studies. Research is continuously being updated, and newer, more efficient materials may have been developed after the latest available data.
