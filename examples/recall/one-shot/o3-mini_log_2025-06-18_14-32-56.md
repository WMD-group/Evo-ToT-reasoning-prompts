===== one-shot =====
Below is one way to summarize literature‐reported records for high‐performance thermoelectric materials. (Note that the reported ZT values can depend on sample quality, measurement temperature, and doping/processing methods. The numbers below are approximate “record” or optimized values found in the literature.)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
Material                           | Approximate ZT Value | Temperature Range  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
SnSe (single crystal, p‑type)       | ≈ 2.6              | ≈ 900–950 K  
PbTe‑based alloys (doped)            | ≈ 2.2              | ≈ 800–900 K  
AgPbₘSbTe₂₊ₘ (“LAST” compounds)     | ≈ 2.0              | ~600–700 K  
GeTe‑based compounds (optimized)     | ≈ 2.0              | High‑temperature (~700–800 K)  
Yb‑filled CoSb₃ (skutterudites)      | ≈ 1.7              | ≈ 850 K  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

A few comments on this table:

• SnSe single crystals have attracted a great deal of attention after reports of ZT ~2.6 along certain crystallographic directions at high temperatures.

• PbTe‐based materials, when properly doped and alloyed, show very high ZT values at elevated temperatures.

• AgPbₘSbTe₂₊ₘ (often called LAST for “lead–antimony–silver–telluride”) is a complex chalcogenide that benefits from nanostructuring and point‐defect scattering.

• GeTe‐based thermoelectrics can reach ZT values around 2 when optimized with appropriate alloying or doping.

• Filled skutterudites (such as Yb‑filled CoSb₃) are also among the high‑performance materials, with ZT values typically reported near 1.7 at high temperatures.

Keep in mind that “best” performance can be application dependent (for example, Bi₂Te₃‑based materials still dominate near‑room‑temperature applications with ZT ≈ 1.0–1.2). The values above represent some of the highest reported ZT “records” for materials operating usually in the mid‐to‐high temperature ranges.
