As of my last update, the performance of thermoelectric materials is often measured using the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The ZT value is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of a thermoelectric material. Below are some of the top-performing thermoelectric materials that are frequently cited along with their approximate ZT values:

| Material                   | Approximate ZT Value | Temperature Range (°C) |
|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| SnSe (Tin Selenide)        | ~2.6                 | 873 K (600 °C)         |
| Bi2Te3 (Bismuth Telluride) | ~1.0 to 1.2          | Room Temperature       |
| PbTe (Lead Telluride)      | ~2.2                 | 773 K (500 °C)         |
| GeTe (Germanium Telluride) | ~2.4                 | 700 °C                 |
| Skutterudites              | ~1.7                 | 500-700 K (226-427 °C) |

Please note that the ZT values can vary based on specific compositions, doping, and the synthesis method of the materials. Additionally, ongoing research might lead to the discovery of new materials or enhanced performance of existing materials, so it's always a good idea to check the latest scientific literature for the most current data.
