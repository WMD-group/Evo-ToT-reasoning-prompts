Below is an example table of five thermoelectric materials that have been reported to show very high performance. Note that the ZT (figure‐of‐merit) values depend on many factors such as composition, microstructure, fabrication methods, and the temperature range at which they are measured. The numbers below are representative values reported in the literature and are subject to ongoing refinement as materials research progresses.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Material                          Reported ZT Value   Temperature Range
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Tin Selenide (SnSe)               ~2.6             ~900–950 K 
   • Single‐crystal SnSe along its
     b-axis has shown record values.
     
2. Lead Telluride (PbTe-based)        ~2.2             700–900 K 
   • Optimized/doped PbTe alloys (e.g., with Sr, Na, or Se alloying)
     have reached high ZT at elevated temperatures.
     
3. Copper Selenide (Cu2Se)            ~2.0             ~900–1000 K 
   • Nanostructured or phase‐controlled forms of Cu2Se
     show strong thermoelectric performance.
     
4. Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3)-based    ~2.0*            Near room temperature 
   Superlattices
   • While bulk Bi2Te3 is typically near 1.0,
     nanostructured/superlattice designs have been reported
     to achieve much higher effective ZT.
     
5. Filled Skutterudites (e.g.,         ~1.7             800–900 K 
   Yb14MnSb11)
   • Complex cage-like structures where “rattler”
     atoms help scatter phonons, enhancing ZT.
-----------------------------------------------------------

* For Bi2Te3–based materials, the high ZT values are usually reported in engineered thin films or superlattices rather than in bulk. 

Keep in mind that these values are approximate and that “best performance” is highly dependent on the temperature range of application. New materials and improved processing techniques continue to push these numbers higher in both bulk and nanostructured forms.
