===== one-shot =====
Below is one way to summarize recent records in thermoelectric performance. Keep in mind that the ZT value of a thermoelectric material is not an absolute constant—it depends on the temperature range, sample quality, and how the material is processed (e.g., via nanostructuring or doping). The following table shows one set of “top‐performing” materials where record or near‐record ZT values have been reported. (Note that different research groups may report slightly different values and operating temperatures.) 

───────────────────────────────────────────  
Material                          | ZT Value (approx.) | Temperature Range  
───────────────────────────────────────────  
Tin Selenide (SnSe)               | ~2.6             | High temperatures (~900 K)  
Nanostructured Lead Telluride (PbTe)| ~2.0 – 2.2       | Mid‐ to high temperatures (~700–800 K)  
Filled Skutterudites (e.g., Yb/CoSb₃) | ~1.7          | Mid temperatures (~700 K)  
Magnesium Antimonide (Mg₃Sb₂-based)| ~1.65           | Moderate temperatures (~500–600 K)  
Bismuth Telluride (Bi₂Te₃-based)    | ~1.5            | Near room temperature (~300–400 K)  
───────────────────────────────────────────  

A few points to note:
• SnSe in its single‐crystal form has attracted wide attention for its record ZT at high temperatures.
• PbTe has seen strong performance improvements due to nanostructuring that helps reduce its thermal conductivity.
• Skutterudite compounds can be “filled” with rare‐earth or other atoms to independently tune electrical and thermal transport.
• Mg₃Sb₂-based materials have emerged as competitive n‐type semiconductors in medium‐temperature applications.
• Bi₂Te₃ remains the “workhorse” for room‐temperature solid‐state cooling and power generation, with continuing research to boost its ZT further.

Because research in thermoelectrics is very active, these numbers may evolve with improvements in synthesis and measurement methods.
