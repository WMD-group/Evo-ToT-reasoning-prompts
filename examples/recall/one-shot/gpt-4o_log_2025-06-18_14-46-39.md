Thermoelectric materials are characterized by their dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, which is used to evaluate their efficiency in converting heat to electricity. Here's a representation of some of the top-performing thermoelectric materials based on recent data:

| Material          | ZT Value | Temperature Range (K) | Notes                                    |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| SnSe (Tin Selenide) | ~2.6    | ~923                  | High ZT due to low thermal conductivity  |
| Bi2Te3 (Bismuth Telluride) | ~2.4    | 300-400              | Commonly used in room temperature applications|
| PbTe (Lead Telluride) | ~2.2    | ~800                  | Improved with doping and nanostructuring |
| Mg3Sb2 (Magnesium Antimonide) | ~1.8    | 600-800              | Promising for mid-temperature applications|
| TAGS (AgSbTe2-GeTe system) | ~1.7    | 300-700              | Good performance over a wide temp range |

These materials have been the focus of significant research efforts to enhance their performance through various methods such as doping, nanostructuring, and alloying. ZT values can vary slightly based on the specific composition and processing methods applied in the experiments.
