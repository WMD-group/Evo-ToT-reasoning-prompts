===== Setting the rules for evolutionary tree of thought =====
Certainly, let's have three experts tackle this task. 

### Step 1: Initial Ideas and Selection

**Expert 1:** 
I will start by considering well-known thermoelectric materials, traditionally used for their high performance. Material selection should be based on known high ZT values. Let's start with Bismuth Telluride (Bi₂Te₃), Lead Telluride (PbTe), and Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) as they have historically been high performers.

**Expert 2:** 
I'll look at recent developments and breakthroughs in the field. Skutterudites and Half-Heusler alloys have been promising due to their high efficiencies and relatively abundant element composition. I agree with PbTe and will also bring in Skutterudites and Half-Heusler alloys to our list.

**Expert 3:** 
Focusing on novel strategies, I will consider materials that have shown high ZT values due to innovative designs such as nanostructuring or unique compositions. Tin Selenide (SnSe) and Magnesium Silicide (Mg₂Si) seem appropriate choices due to recent advancements in their thermoelectric performance. 

### Step 2: Analysis and Comparison

**Expert 1:** 
Let's compare these materials based on their thermoelectric efficiency. Bi₂Te₃, for example, is well-regarded for its efficiency at room temperature with ZT values above 1. It primarily relies on nanostructuring to enhance properties. 

**Expert 2:** 
PbTe is known for high efficiency over a broad temperature range. Advances in nano-engineering and doping to reduce thermal conductivity have led to ZT values exceeding 2. Skutterudites have improved through void-induced phonon scattering, achieving ZT of around 1.5.

**Expert 3:** 
Let's look at SnSe, which has stunned the community with ZT values above 2.5 at 800K due to an anisotropic nature and layered structure reducing thermal conductivity. Mg₂Si is also noteworthy due to its non-toxic and abundant nature but requires intensive manipulation to achieve competitive ZT values.

### Step 3: Evaluating Design Strategies

**Expert 1:** 
Bi₂Te₃ uses band engineering and nanostructuring for fine-tuning electronic and phononic properties, maintaining its position as a leading room-temperature material. However, reliance on tellurium, a scarce element, presents challenges.

**Expert 2:** 
Half-Heusler alloys benefit from intrinsic alloy disorder and band convergence to enhance performance. Skutterudites have innovatively used the PGEC concept, incorporating filler atoms to scatter heat-carrying phonons.

**Expert 3:** 
SnSe's impressive performance comes from its unique crystal structure and anisotropic thermal transport properties. Mg₂Si leverages alloying and nanostructuring to improve its otherwise modest thermoelectric properties.

### Step 4: Conclusion and Summary

**Expert 1:** 
Despite challenges with materials like Bi₂Te₃, it remains unrivaled at room temperature applications. Efforts to substitute tellurium with less scarce alternatives need emphasis.

**Expert 2:** 
PbTe and Half-Heusler alloys stand out for mid- to high-temperature applications, with potential for further improvements through continued research in electronic structure manipulation and thermal conductivity reduction.

**Expert 3:** 
The development of SnSe as a high ZT material highlights the progress possible with innovative approaches. Mg₂Si provides an eco-friendly alternative, though it requires further development to match the efficiency of other materials.

In summary, the best-known high-performance thermoelectric materials currently include Bi₂Te₃, PbTe, Skutterudites, Half-Heusler alloys, and SnSe, each benefiting from unique design strategies such as nanostructuring, phonon engineering, and material design optimizations.

===== Retrieve more materials =====
Given the restriction to exclude previously mentioned materials, let's proceed with a fresh perspective. We'll explore alternative, emerging materials that show promise in thermoelectric applications. Our goal remains to identify five high-performance thermoelectric materials by comparing their design strategies, thermoelectric efficiencies, and other relevant factors.

### Step 1: Initial Ideas and Material Selection

**Expert 1:** 
I'll focus on materials that are gaining attention due to unique structural properties. Consider Bismuth-Antimony (Bi-Sb) alloys, which have shown potential for high thermoelectric performance, particularly in lower temperatures near cryogenic conditions due to their high electron mobility.

**Expert 2:** 
Opting for materials that exhibit intrinsic nanostructuring, I propose looking into Topological Insulators like Bi₂Se₃. These materials offer promising thermoelectric properties owing to their surface states that provide a high density of states near the Fermi level.

**Expert 3:** 
I'll investigate oxide-based thermoelectric materials, such as Calcium Cobalt Oxides (CaxCoO₂). These materials are known for high thermal stability and environmental friendliness, suitable for high-temperature applications.

### Step 2: Analysis and Comparison

**Expert 1:** 
Bi-Sb alloys exhibit high ZT values at low temperatures due to their small bandgap and high seebeck coefficient. Their utility in low-temperature thermoelectric generation is notable due to anisotropic transport properties.

**Expert 2:** 
Bi₂Se₃ as a topological insulator leverages surface states for enhanced electron transport, resulting in promising ZT values, especially when nanostructured. The challenge remains in optimizing bulk conductivity to match surface characteristics.

**Expert 3:** 
Calcium cobalt oxides exhibit ZT values around 0.8 to 1 at high temperatures. Their design utilizes layered crystal structures facilitating phonon scattering, moderately enhancing thermal conductivity, which aligns well with high temperature stability.

### Step 3: Evaluating Design Strategies

**Expert 1:** 
In Bi-Sb alloys, the strategy lies in optimizing the composition for band engineering and exploiting anisotropic electronic transport for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Alloy development continues to refine these attributes.

**Expert 2:** 
Topological insulators like Bi₂Se₃ benefit from band inversion and surface state enhancement for charge carrier mobility. This approach increases thermoelectric performance via surface state exploitation.

**Expert 3:** 
Calcium cobalt oxides use a natural layered structure intrinsic to their thermoelectric design; enhancing phonon-glass like behavior while maintaining decent electrical properties through element substitution and nano-engineering.

### Step 4: Conclusion and Summary

**Expert 1:** 
Bi-Sb alloys are established for their high performance at cryogenic temperatures and highlight the importance of band engineering to optimize properties for specific temperature ranges.

**Expert 2:** 
Bi₂Se₃'s efficient surface state electron transport illustrates innovative frontier approaches. Nanostructure optimization is key to unlocking its potential utility in practical devices.

**Expert 3:** 
Calcium cobalt oxides align well with eco-friendly thermoelectrics for sustaining high-temperature applications, with ongoing improvements feasible through innovative structuring techniques.

In conclusion, this examination of alternative high-performance thermoelectric materials demonstrates the potential of Bi-Sb alloys, Topological Insulators (Bi₂Se₃), and Calcium Cobalt Oxides for enhancing thermoelectric efficiency through strategic design and material innovations, without reliance on traditional scarce or toxic elements. The exploration of transition metal silicides and organic/inorganic hybrid materials could provide further avenues for advancement.
