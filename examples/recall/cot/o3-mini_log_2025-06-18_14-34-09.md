Below is one representative list of five top-performing thermoelectric materials along with approximate maximum ZT values reported in the literature. Note that the exact ZT numbers depend on factors such as synthesis, doping, nanostructuring, and the measurement temperature. The values shown here are approximate peak values achieved under optimized conditions.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Material                                 | Approximate ZT Value  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  
SnSe (single crystal)                    | ~2.6 (measured near 923 K)  
Doped PbTe (lead telluride)              | ~2.2 (measured near 823 K)  
Filled Skutterudites (e.g., YbₓCo₄Sb₁₂)   | ~1.7 (measured near 850 K)  
Half-Heusler compounds (e.g., ZrNiSn-type)| ~1.5 (at intermediate temperatures)  
Bi₂Te₃-based alloys                      | ~1.0 (optimal near room temperature)  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  

Additional Notes:
• The ZT of SnSe, for example, benefits from its low thermal conductivity along a specific crystallographic direction.
• PbTe and skutterudite systems have been extensively optimized via alloying and nanostructuring to improve their thermoelectric performance.
• Bi₂Te₃-based materials remain popular for near-room-temperature applications even though their ZT is lower than those measured at high temperature for other materials.
• Research in thermoelectrics is active, and ongoing work continues to push these values higher under various operating conditions.

This table summarizes one view of the “top 5” materials based on high measured ZT values under optimized conditions. Different research groups might list other promising candidates (such as Mg₃Sb₂-based compounds or clathrate systems), but the materials above are well recognized for their outstanding performance in thermoelectric conversion.
