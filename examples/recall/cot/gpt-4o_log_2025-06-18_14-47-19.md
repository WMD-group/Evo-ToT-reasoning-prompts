Thermoelectric materials are evaluated based on their dimensionless figure of merit, \( ZT \), which determines their efficiency in converting temperature gradients into electric voltage and vice versa. Here are some of the best performing thermoelectric materials as of recent studies:

| Rank | Material                        | ZT Value | Temperature (K) |
|------|---------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1    | SnSe (Tin Selenide)             | 2.6      | 923             |
| 2    | PbTe-SrTe (Lead Telluride-SrTe) | 2.2      | 900             |
| 3    | Cu2Se (Copper Selenide)         | ~2.0     | 1000            |
| 4    | Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 (Bismuth Telluride-Antimony Telluride) | ~1.86 | 300             |
| 5    | Mg3Sb2 (Magnesium Antimonide)   | ~1.5     | 725             |

### Notes:

1. **SnSe (Tin Selenide)**: Known for its exceptional thermoelectric performance at high temperatures. Its high \( ZT \) value is largely due to very low thermal conductivity.

2. **PbTe-SrTe (Lead Telluride-SrTe)**: A composite that exhibits superior thermoelectric performance with doping, widely used in mid-to-high temperature applications.

3. **Cu2Se (Copper Selenide)**: Shows high \( ZT \) at elevated temperatures. It has unique crystal structures that contribute to its efficiency.

4. **Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 (Bismuth Telluride-Antimony Telluride)**: Traditional thermoelectric material widely used at room temperatures and known for its reliable performance.

5. **Mg3Sb2 (Magnesium Antimonide)**: Newer material with promising thermoelectric properties, particularly in moderate temperature ranges.

These values and rankings can change with advancing research and development in thermoelectric materials.
