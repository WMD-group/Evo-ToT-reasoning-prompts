Below is one commonly cited list of high‐performance thermoelectric materials along with their approximate maximum ZT values. (Keep in mind that the numbers below are approximate record values reported in the literature; actual ZT values depend on composition, processing, and operating temperature.)

--------------------------------------------------------------
Rank   Material                        Approximate ZT Value
--------------------------------------------------------------
1      SnSe (tin selenide)             ~2.6 (at around 900 K)
2      Cu2Se (copper selenide)         ~2.5 (at temperatures near 1000 K)
3      PbTe-based alloys               ~2.0 (typically at 700–800 K)
4      Half-Heusler compounds          ~1.5 (e.g., Hf₀.₅Zr₀.₅NiSn near 600 K)
5      Bi₂Te₃-based compounds         ~1.2–1.5 (optimized for room temperature)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
• SnSe and Cu₂Se have drawn major attention recently due to their record‐high ZT values at elevated temperatures.
• PbTe-based alloys have long been regarded as high‐performance thermoelectrics for mid‐temperature applications.
• Half-Heusler compounds and optimized Bi₂Te₃-based materials are especially important for near-room-temperature and moderate-temperature applications.
• Reported ZT values are achieved under specific doping, nanostructuring, and processing conditions and can vary from study to study.

This table represents one snapshot of the state-of-the-art based on available literature and may evolve as new materials and improvements are reported.
