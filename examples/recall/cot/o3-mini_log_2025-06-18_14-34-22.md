Below is a step‐by‐step explanation followed by a table summarizing five notable thermoelectric materials along with representative maximum ZT values (the “figure‐of‐merit” for thermoelectrics). Note that the reported ZT values depend on factors such as temperature, doping, and processing methods. The values given here are representative maximum numbers published in the literature for optimized systems.

Step 1. Identify high‐performance candidates.  
Researchers have long focused on material systems like SnSe, PbTe-based alloys, Cu₂Se, Bi₂Te₃-based materials, and filled skutterudites because they offer low thermal conductivity with high electrical performance. In the recent literature, many of these systems have achieved large ZT values at their respective optimal temperature ranges.

Step 2. Consider temperature ranges.  
• SnSe, PbTe-based alloys, Cu₂Se, and filled skutterudites typically show peak performance at elevated temperatures (500–1000 K).  
• Bi₂Te₃-based materials remain the standard for room‑temperature applications (around 300 K).

Step 3. Prepare the table summarizing these materials and their typical maximum ZT values.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Material                        | Maximum ZT*       | Temperature Range (Approx.)  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Tin Selenide (SnSe)             | ~2.6              | 800–923 K  
Lead Telluride (PbTe-based)     | ~2.0–2.2          | 600–850 K  
Copper Selenide (Cu₂Se)         | ~2.0              | High temperatures (typically >700 K)  
Bismuth Telluride (Bi₂Te₃-based)  | ~1.2 – 1.5        | ~300 K (room temperature)  
Filled Skutterudites (e.g., CoSb₃-based)  
                              | ~1.7              | 600–850 K  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  

*Note: Reported ZT values can vary with composition tuning and nanostructuring.  

These five examples illustrate some of the most encouraging materials for thermoelectric applications. Ongoing research continues to push these values higher by engineering defects, tuning nanostructures, and exploring new alloying strategies.
