As of the latest data available to me, I can provide information on some of the high-performance thermoelectric materials reported in scientific literature. The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, is a commonly used measure of a material's thermoelectric performance, and a higher ZT value indicates better performance. Hereâ€™s a table summarizing some of the top-performing thermoelectric materials:

| Material                  | ZT Value | Temperature (K) | Notes                                                      |
|---------------------------|----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| SnSe (single crystal)     | ~2.6     | 923 K           | Known for its outstanding performance near its phase transition. High ZT due to low thermal conductivity. |
| PbTe-Se (alloy)           | ~2.2     | 923 K           | Alloying and nanostructuring techniques improve its performance. Commonly used in mid-temperature range applications. |
| Mg3Sb2-based compounds    | ~2.0     | 725 K           | n-type high-efficiency material with reduced thermal conductivity and increased power factor. |
| Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattices | ~2.4     | Room Temperature| High performance due to reduced dimensionality and enhanced electron transport properties. |
| Cu2Se                     | ~1.5     | 1000 K          | Exhibits liquid-like behavior resulting in low thermal conductivity and high ZT values at high temperatures. |

Please note that the field of thermoelectric materials is actively researched, and new materials and improvements are regularly reported. Consequently, the values and materials listed here may be subject to change as new research becomes available. Always refer to the latest literature for the most current information.
