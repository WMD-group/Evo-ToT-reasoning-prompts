### Hypotheses Evaluation and Filtering

Based on the evaluations and the need to maintain feasibility and minimize risk, let's filter the current hypotheses:

1. **CoCrFeNiCu**
   - **Validity:** 8
   - **Novelty:** 7
   - **Significance:** 8
   - **Feasibility:** 7
   - **Risk:** 6
   - **Killer Property/Effect:** Enhanced Seebeck coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity.

2. **AlFeNiCoCu + PANI**
   - **Validity:** 7
   - **Novelty:** 8
   - **Significance:** 8
   - **Feasibility:** 6
   - **Risk:** 7
   - **Killer Property/Effect:** Enhanced electrical conductivity and unique interfaces for phonon scattering.

3. **SnSe + PPy**
   - **Validity:** 9
   - **Novelty:** 8
   - **Significance:** 9
   - **Feasibility:** 6
   - **Risk:** 6
   - **Killer Property/Effect:** Enhanced electrical conductivity with minimal impact on the Seebeck coefficient and effective phonon scattering.

### Filtering Decision

Given the criteria, all three hypotheses have relatively high validity, novelty, and significance. However, the feasibility and risk factors are critical. The hypothesis with the highest feasibility and lowest risk should be prioritized:

- **CoCrFeNiCu**: Feasibility 7, Risk 6
- **AlFeNiCoCu + PANI**: Feasibility 6, Risk 7
- **SnSe + PPy**: Feasibility 6, Risk 6

**Decision:** We will keep **CoCrFeNiCu** due to its higher feasibility and lower risk. We need to find a replacement for one of the other hypotheses due to their lower feasibility and higher risk.
