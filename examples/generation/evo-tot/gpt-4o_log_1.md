===== generating hypothesis with chemical formulas =====
To propose new thermoelectric materials and determine their compositions and feasibility, several steps, checks, and considerations should be taken into account. Below are the guidelines to follow, ensuring that the proposed compositions are chemically feasible:

### Steps to Propose New Thermoelectric Materials and Chemical Formulas

1. **Define the Material System:**
   - Begin by clearly defining what kind of material you are proposing (e.g., composite, layered, high entropy alloy, etc.).

2. **Identify Base Components:**
   - Identify the key components or elements that will form the material. For example, choose suitable perovskites, rare-earth elements, and other components like graphene or metals.

3. **Propose Initial Formulation:**
   - Draft a preliminary chemical formula or composition based on the intended material properties and functionalities. For example, a hybrid perovskite composite with graphene could be represented as (\(A^{+}B^{2+}X_3\)/Graphene).

4. **Consider Chemical Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that the selected components are chemically compatible and do not react unfavourably with each other when synthesized.

5. **Check Chemical Rules and Principles:**
   - **Charge Balance:** Ensure that the overall charge is balanced in the proposed compound.
   - **Stoichiometry:** Confirm that the ratios of elements adhere to known stoichiometric rules.
   - **Valency:** Verify that elements have compatible oxidation states.
   - **Phase Stability:** Utilize phase diagrams, if available, to ensure stability.
   - **Solubility Limits:** Check if the components can be incorporated into the material without exceeding solubility limits.

6. **Examine Structural Considerations:**
   - Use crystallography insights to verify that the proposed structure is feasible.
   - Assess whether the elements and components can fit into the proposed crystal lattice or structure.

7. **Advanced Simulations and Algorithms:**
   - Implement computational tools like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or machine-learning algorithms to predict structural stability and electronic properties.

8. **Feasibility Analysis:**

- Graphene intercalation indicated as \(C_{x}\) (where x indicates the proportion relative to the perovskite)
- Rare-Earth Doping: \(RE_x\) (e.g., \(La_{0.1}\)) for substitution or intercalation purposes

**Proposed Formula:** \((CH_3NH_3PbI_3/C_x)\RE_y\), where x and y are proportions determined by stoichiometry, compatibility, and desired properties.

**Feasibility Comments:**
- **Validity:** The inclusion of graphene aims to enhance thermal properties, which is chemically sound.
- **Novelty and Significance:** Combining rare-earths may improve carrying capacities—novel and potentially beneficial.
