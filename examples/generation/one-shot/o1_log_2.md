Below is a reasoned discussion about the concept of a “brand-new” thermoelectric material, plus a hypothetical example of an unreported composition you might explore. Importantly, however, there is no guarantee in science that any suggested composition truly has “never been reported”—the literature is vast, and new results appear all the time. You would need to do a thorough literature search (e.g., using databases like Web of Science, Scopus, or specialized search engines) to confirm whether something is genuinely novel.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Why it’s challenging to propose something truly “unreported”
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Enormous candidate space: Materials research is interdisciplinary and global. Many “new” compounds turn out to have been studied (even briefly) in less accessible journals or as a side note in broader investigations.  
• Ongoing discovery: High-throughput computational screenings regularly predict new compounds or doping strategies. A material might be described in a preprint or a patent that is not widely cited.  
• Uncertainty: Even if a phase or composition is novel, it might be unstable or challenging to synthesize in practice, making it difficult to confirm whether it truly qualifies as a “new thermoelectric.”

Because of these considerations, researchers usually demonstrate novelty by comparing to existing knowledge: systematically citing or screening through existing databases, referencing known isostructural compounds, and analyzing whether the proposed doping or composition has already been tried.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. A hypothetical example material and rationale (illustration only)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For purposes of illustration, let’s consider a quaternary chalcogenide in the family of Cu2XSnY4-related materials (where X and Y could be sulfur, selenium, or tellurium, possibly mixed). Many variants are known for photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications (e.g., Cu2ZnSnS4, commonly studied for solar cells), but doping or substituting some of the metal atoms with rare-earth or transition-metal cations might yield new phases with potentially high thermoelectric performance. 

Imagine substituting part of the Zn with a heavier element like Cd or In, or partially replacing Sn with a rare-earth element such as Yb. The combination could be something like:  
• Cu2–δ(Cd,In)(Sn,Yb)(S,Se)4  
(with carefully tuned stoichiometry to balance charge).  

Potential rationale:  
1) Layered or quasi-layered structures in Cu-based chalcogenides can exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity, beneficial for thermoelectric performance.  
2) Partial substitution with heavy elements (like Cd or In) sometimes reduces thermal conductivity further due to enhanced phonon scattering.  
3) Rare-earth ions (such as Yb) can sometimes provide high Seebeck coefficients, if they form intermediate valence states or introduce localized electronic states.  

Is this exact composition “never” reported? It’s not trivial to guarantee. Some doping or partial substitution might indeed be uncharted—or might only exist in an obscure paper. Nonetheless, quaternary or quinary doping in such families remains an active area of research, and you might find new or underexplored phases.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Why propose a chalcogenide-based layered system?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Known success in thermoelectrics: Many conventional high-performance thermoelectrics (e.g., Bi2Te3, PbTe, SnSe) are chalcogenides and rely on relatively heavy atoms and layered structures. This structural motif usually helps reduce thermal conductivity.  
• Tuning flexibility: Multi-element chalcogenides can be tuned extensively (by choice of cation/anion, doping, etc.) to try and optimize the crucial thermoelectric parameters (carrier concentration, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity).  
• Inspiration from existing breakthroughs: The success of Cu2Se, CuFeS2, and Cu2SnSe3 for thermoelectric or related energy applications suggests that more exotic doping or composition changes might yield improved or novel performance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. What is the inspiration?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Observations of known chalcogenides with impressive thermoelectric figures of merit (ZT): SnSe, for example, achieved high ZT values due to ultralow thermal conductivity. Researchers often look to related compounds or doping approaches to replicate that success.  
• High-throughput predictions: The computational materials discovery community uses advanced methods (e.g., density functional theory combined with machine learning) to screen large chemical spaces. In many of these predictions, certain “long tail” compositions do not get immediate experimental follow-up. Drawing on those might reveal untested candidates.  
• Exploratory doping: Systematic doping in known families of thermoelectric materials can lead to new phases. Even if the base structure is known, a specific doping recipe can produce a previously uncharacterized compound with better performance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Key caveat
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Any claim of a truly novel material requires:  
• Comprehensive literature survey: Checking major databases, journals, and existing patents.  
• Synthesis and characterization: Even if theoretically predicted to be stable and/or have promising thermoelectric properties, you must demonstrate that you can actually synthesize it in stable form.  
• Documentation: Publish your methods (synthesis route, doping strategy, property measurements) to confirm reproducibility and novelty.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
It is extremely difficult to guarantee that any single composition has “never been reported.” If you want to pursue a potentially new thermoelectric, consider systematically exploring families that are known to have excellent thermoelectric or allied energy-conversion properties—such as metal chalcogenides, half-Heuslers, skutterudites, or Zintl phases—and propose doping or substituting elements in ways not yet documented in mainstream literature. A composition like Cu2–δ(Cd,In)(Sn,Yb)(S,Se)4 (or another carefully chosen quaternary/quinary variant) might warrant investigation for novel behaviors, but confirming its originality and viability requires thorough literature review and experimental validation.

In short, the best way to find the “next promising” material is to do what researchers do continually: use known structure–property principles, cross-reference databases, and push into composition regions that are underexplored. Then, follow up with careful synthesis, characterization, and peer-reviewed publication to confirm novelty.
