I cannot give you the composition of a *guaranteed* novel, promising thermoelectric material that has never been reported.  Predicting the exact composition of a breakthrough material before any research has been done is essentially impossible.  Scientific discovery relies on experimentation and iterative refinement, not just theoretical prediction.

However, I can give you some potential avenues and inspiration based on current trends in thermoelectric research, which you can use as a starting point for your own investigations:

**Potential Research Directions & Inspirations:**

1. **High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with targeted phonon scattering:** HEAs offer a vast compositional space to explore.  Focus on combinations of elements that create complex microstructures leading to strong phonon scattering (reducing thermal conductivity) while maintaining good electronic properties.  Explore transition metal-based HEAs with varying valence electron counts and atomic radii differences.  Consider adding light elements like Al or Si for further phonon scattering. *Inspiration:* The success of some HEAs as high-temperature structural materials and the general principle of using structural complexity to reduce thermal conductivity.

2. **Complex layered oxides with anharmonicity:**  Layered oxides can exhibit low thermal conductivity due to structural anharmonicity. Explore combinations of transition metals with different bonding preferences and oxidation states to create structures with rattling modes or weak interlayer bonding. *Inspiration:*  The low thermal conductivity observed in some complex layered cobaltates.

3. **Metal chalcogenides with topological features:**  Topological insulators and semimetals have unique electronic band structures that could be beneficial for thermoelectric performance. Explore combinations of heavy elements (e.g., Bi, Sb, Te) with transition metals to tune the electronic band structure and achieve high power factors.*Inspiration:*  The enhanced thermoelectric properties observed in some topological materials.

4. **Organic-inorganic hybrid materials:**  Combine organic molecules with inorganic frameworks to achieve low thermal conductivity through the disordered organic component while maintaining electronic transport through the inorganic framework. *Inspiration:* The success of hybrid materials in other functional applications, like photovoltaics.



**How to validate novelty:**

Crucially, after coming up with a potential composition, you must perform a thorough literature search (using databases like Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and materials databases like Materials Project) to ensure that the material hasn't been previously studied for its thermoelectric properties. Additionally, checking patent databases is also important.

**Why these are promising (in principle):**

The key to good thermoelectric performance lies in the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT.  ZT = (S^2 * σ * T) / κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal conductivity. The strategies mentioned above aim to decouple these often-interrelated properties:

* **Reduce thermal conductivity (κ):** Complex structures, heavy elements, anharmonicity, and interfaces scatter phonons (heat carriers), reducing κ.
* **Maintain/enhance electronic properties (S and σ):**  Band engineering, doping, and optimized carrier concentrations can enhance the power factor (S^2σ).


Remember that materials science is complex.  Even theoretically promising compositions may not perform as expected in experiments.  But by carefully considering the underlying principles of thermoelectricity and exploring novel compositional spaces, you can increase your chances of discovering a new and promising material.  Good luck!
