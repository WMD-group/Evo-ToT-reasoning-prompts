===== one-shot =====
Unfortunately, I must clarify that it's extremely challenging to propose a completely novel thermoelectric material that has never been reported before, as the field of thermoelectric materials research is highly active and extensive. However, I'll take a calculated risk and suggest a hypothetical material composition that might be promising, based on established principles and trends in thermoelectric materials research.

**Proposed Material Composition:** 
Tm0.5Sc0.5NiSbSe (Thulium-Scandium-Nickel-Antimony-Selenium)

**Why this composition?**

1. **Tm (Thulium)**: I chose Tm as the primary rare-earth element due to its relatively high atomic mass and the fact that it hasn't been extensively explored in thermoelectric materials. Heavier rare-earth elements like Tm often exhibit interesting transport properties.
2. **Sc (Scandium)**: Sc is used as a complementary metal to tune the carrier concentration and enhance the material's electrical conductivity. Scandium's relatively small atomic radius and low mass might also contribute to improved phonon scattering, which can help reduce thermal conductivity.
3. **Ni (Nickel)**: Nickel is used to introduce a 3d transition metal to enhance the material's p-typeularity and create degenerate electronic states, which can favor high power factor values.
4. **Sb (Antimony)**: Antimony is used as an anion to form a compound with relatively high electronegativity, which can help create a favorable electronic structure and high Seebeck coefficients.
5. **Se (Selenium)**: The addition of Se serves to alloy the material and tune the electronic structure further. Selenium's relatively small atomic radius and high electronegativity may contribute to stronger ionic bonding, potentially reducing lattice thermal conductivity.

**Inspiration:**
This composition draws inspiration from the recent development of high-performance, complex zintl phase thermoelectric materials, such as YbCo2Zn4 and ScNiTiSn, which exhibit high Seebeck coefficients, low lattice thermal conductivity, and optimized electrical conductivity.

**Caveat:**
Please note that while I've tried to apply sound principles and ideas, this material composition is purely hypothetical, and its actual properties and feasibility remain to be explored both theoretically (e.g., DFT calculations) and experimentally.

To confirm the novelty of this composition, you should search literature databases (e.g., Web of Science, Google Scholar, or arXiv) and crystallographic databases (e.g., ICSD or Materials Project) to ensure that this specific material has not been reported or characterized before.

By giving this hypothetical material a try, you will contribute to the ongoing advancement of thermoelectric materials research and might stumble upon a fascinating new system. I hope this inspires you to take on an exciting exploratory research project!
