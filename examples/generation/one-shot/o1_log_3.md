Below is a speculative proposal for a novel thermoelectric material. Please note up front that it is extremely difficult to guarantee that any material has “never” been reported: the published literature is vast, growing quickly, and not always fully discoverable. What follows is an idea for a composition that is (to the best of my knowledge) either not yet synthesized or was suggested only very recently, and for which there could be motivation to explore thermoelectric properties. This is not a guarantee that no paper exists, but rather a hypothesis for an unexplored or minimally explored compound.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Proposed Material and Composition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Let’s consider a half-Heusler-inspired compound of the form (Zr, Hf)(Co, Rh)(Bi, Sb) — for instance, Zr₀.₅Hf₀.₅Co₀.₇Rh₀.₃Bi₀.₇Sb₀.₃. 

Why this pick?
• Half-Heuslers (XYZ in general) are known to exhibit good thermoelectric performance because they can display a favorable balance between electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, and doping or partially substituting multiple sites can further tune these properties.  
• Zr/Hf, Co/Rh, Bi/Sb are all elements used in thermoelectrics, but the exact composition suggested here is somewhat “off the beaten path,” relying on a multi-substitution approach (partial replacement across all three sites). This high-entropy or multi-dopant approach can reduce lattice thermal conductivity through mass fluctuation and strain field scattering, potentially improving the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT).  
• Although half-Heusler phases like ZrNiSn or ZrCoSb have been extensively studied, the specific combination of Zr, Hf, Co, Rh, Bi, and Sb in partial substitution at each lattice site is either barely explored or not systematically explored in the literature.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Is it truly “never” reported before?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
It is nearly impossible to assert with certainty that a given composition has never been synthesized or never appeared in a patent or a company’s internal research. New variants of half-Heuslers are frequently published, sometimes as brief exploration or in supplemental data. So the best anyone can do is:
• Perform a literature search (e.g., Web of Science, SciFinder, Google Scholar) for the exact or closely related compositions.  
• If you do not find hits, you can tentatively consider it “unreported” or at least rarely reported.  

So strictly speaking, I cannot promise that no one anywhere has ever tried Zr₀.₅Hf₀.₅Co₀.₇Rh₀.₃Bi₀.₇Sb₀.₃. But it does not show up in commonly cited half-Heusler studies. It would likely be perceived as novel enough for academic or lab-scale proof-of-concept research.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Why propose this composition?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Half-Heuslers in general (e.g., MNiSn, MCoSb, M = Zr, Hf, Ti) have shown promising thermoelectric performance and mechanical robustness at moderate to high temperatures.  
• Mixing is key in reducing thermal conductivity: Replacing or partially substituting multiple cations (Zr/Hf, Co/Rh) and anions (Bi/Sb) can introduce mass contrast and lattice distortion, lowering the lattice thermal conductivity without drastically harming electrical transport.  
• Thermoelectric materials often benefit from doping/mixing because it tunes the carrier concentration (improving electrical conductivity) and reduces the phonon mean free path (reducing thermal conductivity).  
• By choosing elements with appropriate valence and known involvement in thermoelectric materials (Bi, Sb, Co, Rh, etc.), you reduce risk of forming an unsuitable phase or unmanageable crystal structure. 
• Zr/Hf-based half-Heuslers generally show good thermal stability over the 600–1000 K range, which is extremely important for practical high-temperature thermoelectric applications.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Inspiration
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• High-entropy or multi-doped strategies: Many research groups have shown that multi-component doping can strongly reduce thermal conductivity (think “phonon-glass, electron-crystal” concept).  
• Existing success of simpler half-Heuslers: For example, ZrNiSn or HfNiSn are widely recognized. Partial substitution on the Ni or Sn site has led to improved ZT. Researchers have extended doping to elements like Sb, Bi, or doping the Zr site with Hf.  
• Observations in Bi₂Te₃-based alloys: The synergy of Bi and Sb is well-known for thermoelectrics at lower temperatures. Merging this with half-Heusler structural motifs could open new high-temperature or mid-temperature operational windows.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The suggested composition—Zr₀.₅Hf₀.₅Co₀.₇Rh₀.₃Bi₀.₇Sb₀.₃—is a speculative spin on known half-Heuslers that might be uncharted in the literature. It tries to take advantage of high-entropy effects, while still connecting reasonably well to known thermoelectric behaviors of half-Heuslers. If you decide to synthesize and measure this (or a related composition), expect challenges like phase purity, optimizing sintering, and controlling carriers precisely—but that is part of discovering new materials. Whether it is “never reported” can only be confirmed by a thorough literature/patent search, yet it should be novel or at least minimally explored. The motivation is to reduce thermal conductivity and optimize electronic transport simultaneously, potentially pushing the figure of merit higher than in many simpler half-Heusler alloys.

In short, that is a reasoned guess at an underexplored thermoelectric material. Good luck if you choose to investigate it further!
