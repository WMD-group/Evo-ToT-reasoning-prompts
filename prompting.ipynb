      "Killer Effects Explained:\n",
      "• For Half‑Heuslers, the resonant dopant effect sharpens the density‑of‑states.\n",
      "• For Chalcogenide Superlattices, quantum confinement yields strong phonon scattering.\n",
      "• For Hybrid Perovskites, defect tolerance from lone pair electrons and natural quantum confinement are key.\n",
      "• For Core–Shell Skutterudites, the combined core–shell architecture and 2D inclusions create a dual improvement in both carrier and phonon transport.\n",
      "• For High‑Entropy Oxide–Perovskites, configurational disorder leads to extensive phonon scattering while stabilizing the system, paralleling defect‐tolerance mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the original expert hypotheses laid a solid foundation, the current proposals (Core–Shell Skutterudites and High‑Entropy Oxide–Perovskites) integrate advanced nanostructuring and high‑entropy design concepts that overcome limitations of the earlier ideas. Thus, the older expert proposals have been discarded in favor of these optimized, state‑of‑the‑art approaches.\n"
